# Over-the-air firmware update using HTTPS

This code example demonstrates an OTA update with PSoC&trade; 6 MCU and AIROC™ CYW43xxx Wi-Fi & Bluetooth® combo chips. The device establishes a connection with the designated HTTPS server. It periodically checks the job document to see if a new update is available. When a new update is available, it is downloaded and written to the secondary slot. On the next reboot, MCUboot swaps the new image in the secondary slot with the primary slot image and runs the application. If the new image is not validated in runtime, on the next reboot, MCUboot reverts to the previously validated image.

MCUboot is a "secure" bootloader for 32-bit MCUs. See the [README](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-psoc6-mcuboot-basic/blob/master/README.md) of the [mtb-example-psoc6-mcuboot-basic](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-psoc6-mcuboot-basic) code example for more details.

The over-the-air update middleware library enables the OTA feature. See the [ota-update](https://github.com/Infineon/ota-update) middleware repository on GitHub for more details.

## Hardware setup

This example uses the board's default configuration. See the kit user guide to ensure that the board is configured correctly.

## Software setup

Install a terminal emulator if you don't have one. Instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/index.html.en).

This example uses a local-web-server to set up a local HTTP server, see [Setting up an HTTP/HTTPS server using local-web-server](#setting-up-an-httphttps-server-using-local-web-server-based-on-nodejs) for more details.

## Structure and overview

This code example is a dual-core project, where the MCUboot bootloader app runs on the CM0+ core and the OTA update app runs on the CM4 core. The OTA update app fetches the new image and places it in the flash memory; the bootloader takes care of updating the existing image with the new image. The [mtb-example-psoc6-mcuboot-basic](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-psoc6-mcuboot-basic) code example is the bootloader project used for this purpose.

The bootloader project and this OTA update project should be built and programmed independently. They must be placed separately in the workspace as you would do for any other two independent projects. An example workspace will be as follows:

   ```
   <example-workspace>
      |
      |-<mtb-example-psoc6-mcuboot-basic>
      |-<mtb-example-ota-https>
      |
   ```

You must first build and program the MCUboot bootloader project into the CM0+ core; this should be done only once. The OTA update app can then be programmed into the CM4 core; you need to only modify this app for all application purposes.

## Using the code example

Create the project and open it using one of the following:

<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

1. Click the **New Application** link in the **Quick Panel** (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox&trade; Application**). This launches the [Project Creator](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool.

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **Project Creator - Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog.

   When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the Library Manager, click the link from the **Quick Panel**.

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project Creator - Select Application** dialog, choose the example by enabling the checkbox.

4. (Optional) Change the suggested **New Application Name**.

5. The **Application(s) Root Path** defaults to the Eclipse workspace which is usually the desired location for the application. If you want to store the application in a different location, you can change the *Application(s) Root Path* value. Applications that share libraries should be in the same root path.

6. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

For more details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details><summary><b>In command-line interface (CLI)</b></summary>

ModusToolbox&trade; software provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and the command line tool, "project-creator-cli". The CLI tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the "project-creator-cli" tool. On Windows, use the command line "modus-shell" program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; software installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; software tools. You can access it by typing `modus-shell` in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

The "project-creator-cli" tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

<br>

The following example clones the "[mtb-example-ota-https](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-ota-https)" application with the desired name "OtaHttps" configured for the *CY8CPROTO-062-4343W* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id CCY8CPROTO-062-4343W --app-id mtb-example-ota-https --user-app-name OtaHttps --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```

**Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can invoke the Library Manager GUI tool from the terminal using `make library-manager` command or use the Library Manager CLI tool "library-manager-cli" to change the BSP.

The "library-manager-cli" tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--add-bsp-name` | Name of the BSP that should be added to the application | Required
`--set-active-bsp` | Name of the BSP that should be as active BSP for the application | Required
`--add-bsp-version`| Specify the version of the BSP that should be added to the application if you do not wish to use the latest from manifest | Optional
`--add-bsp-location`| Specify the location of the BSP (local/shared) if you prefer to add the BSP in a shared path | Optional

<br>

Following example adds the CY8CPROTO-062-4343W BSP to the already created application and makes it the active BSP for the app:

   ```
   ~/ModusToolbox/tools_{version}/library-manager/library-manager-cli --project "C:/mtb_projects/OtaHttps" --add-bsp-name CY8CPROTO-062-4343W --add-bsp-version "latest-v4.X" --add-bsp-location "local"

   ~/ModusToolbox/tools_{version}/library-manager/library-manager-cli --project "C:/mtb_projects/OtaHttps" --set-active-bsp APP_CY8CPROTO-062-4343W
   ```

</details>

<details><summary><b>In third-party IDEs</b></summary>

Use one of the following options:

- **Use the standalone [Project Creator](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool:**

   1. Launch Project Creator from the Windows Start menu or from *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/project-creator.exe*.

   2. In the initial **Choose Board Support Package** screen, select the BSP, and click **Next**.

   3. In the **Select Application** screen, select the appropriate IDE from the **Target IDE** drop-down menu.

   4. Click **Create** and follow the instructions printed in the bottom pane to import or open the exported project in the respective IDE.

<br>

- **Use command-line interface (CLI):**

   1. Follow the instructions from the **In command-line interface (CLI)** section to create the application.

   2. Export the application to a supported IDE using the `make <ide>` command.

   3. Follow the instructions displayed in the terminal to create or import the application as an IDE project.

For a list of supported IDEs and more details, see the "Exporting to IDEs" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

## Building and programming MCUboot

The [mtb-example-psoc6-mcuboot-basic](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-psoc6-mcuboot-basic) code example bundles two applications: the bootloader app that runs on CM0+, and the Blinky app that runs on CM4. For this code example, only the bootloader app is required; the root directory of the bootloader app is referred to as *\<bootloader_cm0p>* in this document.

1. Import the [mtb-example-psoc6-mcuboot-basic](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-psoc6-mcuboot-basic) code example per the instructions in the [Using the code example](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-psoc6-mcuboot-basic#using-the-code-example) section of its [README](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-psoc6-mcuboot-basic/blob/master/README.md).

2. The bootloader and OTA applications must have the same understanding of the memory layout. The memory layout is defined through JSON files. The ota-update library provides a set of predefined JSON files that can be readily used. Both the bootloader and OTA application must use the same JSON file.

   The *\<mtb_shared>/ota-update/\<tag>/configs/flashmap/* folder contains the pre-defined flashmap JSON files. The following files are supported by this example.

   Target      | Supported JSON files
   ----------- |----------------------------------
   CY8CPROTO-062-4343W <br> CY8CKIT-062S2-43012 <br> CY8CEVAL-062S2-MUR-43439M2 <br> CY8CEVAL-062S2-LAI-4373M2 <br> CY8CEVAL-062S2-LAI-43439M2 <br> CY8CEVAL-062S2-MUR-4373EM2 <br> CY8CEVAL-062S2-MUR-4373M2 <br> CY8CPROTO-062S2-43439 | All six targets support the following flashmaps - <br> *psoc62_2m_ext_overwrite_single.json* <br> *psoc62_2m_ext_swap_single.json* <br> *psoc62_2m_int_overwrite_single.json* <br> *psoc62_2m_int_swap_single.json*
   CY8CPROTO-062S3-4343W | *psoc62_512k_xip_swap_single.json*

   <br>

   Copy the required flashmap JSON file and paste it into the *\<bootloader_cm0p>/flashmap* folder.

3. Modify the value of the `FLASH_MAP` variable in  *\<bootloader_cm0p>/shared_config.mk* to the selected JSON file name from the previous step.

4. Copy the *\<mtb_shared>/mcuboot/\<tag>/boot/cypress/MCUBootApp/config* folder and paste it into the *\<bootloader_cm0p>* folder.

5. Edit the *\<bootloader_cm0p>/config/mcuboot_config/mcuboot_config.h* file and comment out the following defines to skip checking the image signature:

   ```
   #define MCUBOOT_SIGN_EC256
   .
   .
   .
   #define MCUBOOT_VALIDATE_PRIMARY_SLOT
   ```

6. Edit *\<bootloader_cm0p>/app.mk* and replace the MCUboot include `$(MCUBOOTAPP_PATH)/config` with `./config`. This gets the build system to find the new copy of the *config* directory that you pasted into the *\<bootloader_cm0p>* directory, instead of the default one supplied by the library.

7. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

8. Open a CLI terminal.

   On Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application. On Windows, open the **modus-shell** app from the Start menu.

9. Navigate the terminal to the *\<mtb_shared>/mcuboot/\<tag>/scripts* folder.

10. Run the following command to ensure that the required modules are installed or already present ("Requirement already satisfied:" is printed).

      ```
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```

11. Open a serial terminal emulator and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud.

12. Build and program the application per the [Step-by-step](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-psoc6-mcuboot-basic#step-by-step-instructions) instructions in its [README](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-psoc6-mcuboot-basic/blob/master/README.md).

    After programming, the bootloader application starts automatically.

    **Figure 1. Booting with no bootable image**

    ![](images/booting_without_bootable_image.png)

**Note:** This example does not demonstrate securely upgrading the image and booting from it using features such as image signing and secured boot. See the [PSoC&trade; 64 line of "Secure" MCUs](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/microcontroller/32-bit-psoc-arm-cortex-microcontroller/psoc-6-32-bit-arm-cortex-m4-mcu/psoc-64) that offer all those features built around MCUboot.


## Setting up an HTTP/HTTPS server using local-web-server (based on *node.js*)

This code example uses a local server to demonstrate the OTA operation over HTTP/HTTPS. [local-web-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/local-web-server) is used in this example. It is a lean, modular web server for rapid full-stack development.

The root directory of the OTA application is referred to as *\<OTA Application>* in this document.

1. Download and install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Install with default settings. **Do not tick** the checkbox to install optional tools for native modules.

2. Open a CLI terminal.

   On Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application. On Windows, open the *modus-shell* app from the Start menu.

3. Navigate to the *\<OTA Application>/scripts/* folder.

4. Execute the following command to generate self-signed SSL certificates and keys. On Linux and macOS, you can get your device-local IP address by running the `ifconfig` command on any terminal application. On Windows, run the `ipconfig` command on a command prompt.

   ```
   sh generate_ssl_cert.sh <local-ip-address-of-your-pc>
   ```

   Example:
   ```
   sh generate_ssl_cert.sh 192.168.0.10
   ```

   This step will generate the following files in the same *\<OTA Application>/scripts/* directory:

   1. *http_ca.crt* – Root CA certificate
   2. *http_ca.key* – Root CA private key
   3. *http_server.crt* – Server certificate
   4. *http_server.key* – Server private key
   5. *http_client.crt* – Client certificate
   6. *http_client.key* – Client private key

5. Execute the following command to install [local-web-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/local-web-server).

   ```
   npm install -g local-web-server
   ```

6. Start the local HTTP/HTTPS server:

   - **Using the code example in TLS mode (default):** Execute the following command:

      ```
      ws -p 4443 --hostname <local-ip-address-of-your-pc> --https --key http_server.key --cert http_server.crt --keep-alive-timeout 10000 -v
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      ws -p 4443 --hostname 192.168.0.10 --https --key http_server.key --cert http_server.crt --keep-alive-timeout 10000 -v
      ```
      **Figure 2. HTTPS server started in TLS Mode**

      ![](images/https_tls_mode.png)


   - **Using the code example in non-TLS mode:** Execute the following command:

      ```
      ws -p 8080 --hostname <local-ip-address-of-your-pc> --keep-alive-timeout 10000 -v
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      ws -p 8080 --hostname 192.168.0.10 --keep-alive-timeout 10000 -v
      ```

      **Figure 3. HTTPS server started in Non-TLS mode**

      ![](images/https_non_tls_mode.png)

**Note:** If you are running a local-web-server server on a device which is maintained by your organization or institution, the firewall settings may not permit you to host a file server on the local network. To verify whether the file server has been hosted properly, from a device connected to the same local network, check the server link on a browser. Browse for `http://<ip-address-noted-earlier>:<port-number-noted-earlier>`; for example: `http://192.168.0.10:8080`. If the files in the *\<OTA Application>/scripts/* directory are listed on the browser page, you have a properly working file server. Do not proceed to the next section without getting the file server to work.


## Operation

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud.

3. Modify the `OTA_PLATFORM` variable in the *\<OTA Application>/Makefile* based on the target you have selected. Currently, in the Makefile, a conditional `if-else` block is used to automatically select a value based on the target selected. You can remove it and directly assign a value as per the table shown below.

   Target      | `OTA_PLATFORM` value
   ----------- |----------------------------------
   CY8CPROTO-062-4343W <br> CY8CKIT-062S2-43012 <br> CY8CEVAL-062S2-MUR-43439M2 <br> CY8CEVAL-062S2-LAI-4373M2 <br> CY8CEVAL-062S2-LAI-43439M2 <br> CY8CEVAL-062S2-MUR-4373EM2 <br> CY8CEVAL-062S2-MUR-4373M2 <br> CY8CPROTO-062S2-43439 | PSOC_062_2M
   CY8CPROTO-062S3-4343W | PSOC_062_512K

   <br>

4. Modify the `OTA_FLASH_MAP` variable in the *\<OTA Application>/Makefile* to change the JSON file name to match the selection made while programming the bootloader application. Currently, in the Makefile, a conditional `if-else` block is used to automatically select a default flash map file based on the target selected. You can remove it and directly assign the path of the required flash map file to the `OTA_FLASH_MAP` variable.

5. Edit the *\<OTA Application>/source/ota_app_config.h* file to configure your OTA application:

   1. Modify the connection configuration such as the `WIFI_SSID`, `WIFI_PASSWORD`, and `WIFI_SECURITY` macros to match the settings of your Wi-Fi network. Make sure that the device running the HTTP server and the kit are connected to the same network.

   2. Modify the `HTTP_SERVER` address to match the IP address of your HTTP server.

   3. By default, this code example uses HTTPS (TLS) protocol. To use the example in HTTP (non-TLS) mode, modify `ENABLE_TLS` to **false** and skip the next step of adding the certificate.

   4. Add the certificates and key:

      1. Open a CLI terminal.

          On Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application. On Windows, open the *modus-shell* app from the Start menu.

      2. Navigate the terminal to *\<OTA Application>/scripts/* directory.

      3. Run the *format_cert_key.py* Python script to generate the string format of the *http_ca.crt* file that can be added as a macro. Pass the name of the certificate with the extension as an argument to the Python script:

         ```
         python format_cert_key.py <one-or-more-file-name-of-certificate-or-key-with-extension>
         ```

         Example:
         ```
         python format_cert_key.py http_ca.crt
         ```
      4. Copy the generated string and add it to the `ROOT_CA_CERTIFICATE` macro in the *ota_app_config.h* file per the sample shown.

      Note that the local-web-server does not authenticate a client through the certificate; this is the reason why the client certificate and client key are not added here. If you use some other server, which can do client-side authentication, add the *http_client.crt* and *http_client.key* files. Also, set the `USING_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE` and `USING_CLIENT_KEY` macros to value **true**.

6. Edit the job document (*\<OTA Application>/scripts/ota_update.json*):

   1. Modify the value of the `Server` to match the IP address of your HTTP server.

   2. Modify the value of the `Board` to match the kit you are using.

   3. In Step 3, if the code example has been configured to work in non-TLS mode: Set the value of `Port` to **8080** and `Connection` to **HTTP**.

7. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.
   </details>

   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain is specified in the application's Makefile but you can override this value manually:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
   </details>

   At this point, the primary slot is programmed and the CM4 CPU starts running the image from the primary slot on reset. Observe the messages on the UART terminal; wait for the device to make the required connections as shown in Figure 4. Also, the user LED will blink at 1 Hz.

   **Figure 4. Connection to the HTTP server**

   ![](images/connection_http_server.png)

8. The job document placed in the *\<OTA Application>/scripts/* folder has a value of `Version` as **1.0.0**. Because the OTA application version and the available update version are the same, the update will not happen.

9. Modify the value of the `BLINKY_DELAY_MS` macro to **(100)** in the *\<OTA Application>/source/led_task.c* file and change the app version in the *\<OTA Application>/Makefile* by setting `APP_VERSION_MINOR` to **1**.

10. Build the app (**DO NOT** program it to the kit). This new image will be uploaded to the HTTP server in the following steps to demonstrate the OTA update.

   <details open><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade;</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **Build \<OTA Application> Application**.
   </details>

   <details open><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

      1. From the terminal, execute the `make build` command to build the application using the default toolchain to the default target. You can specify a target and toolchain manually:
         ```
         make build TARGET=<BSP> TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
         ```
         Example:
         ```
         make build TARGET=CY8CPROTO-062-4343W TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
         ```
   </details>

11. After a successful build, copy the *mtb-example-ota-https.bin* file from *\<OTA Application>/build/\<KIT>/Debug* and paste it to the *\<OTA Application>/scripts* directory.

12. Edit the *\<OTA Application>/scripts/ota_update.json* file to modify the value of `Version` to **1.1.0**.

13. The OTA application now finds the updated job document, downloads the new image, and places it in the secondary slot. Once the download is complete, a soft reset is issued. The MCUboot bootloader starts the image upgrade process. It will take approximately 15-20 minutes.

    **Figure 5. Image download**

    ![](images/downloading_new_image.png)

14. After the image upgrade is successfully completed, observe that the user LED is now blinking at 5 Hz.

15. To test the revert feature of MCUboot, send a bad image as the v1.2.0 OTA update. The bad image used in this example is an infinite loop. The watchdog timer will reset the bad image and upon reboot, MCUboot will revert the primary image back to the v1.1.0 good image. Edit *\<OTA Application>/Makefile* and add `TEST_REVERT` to the `Defines` variable as shown:

      ```
      DEFINES+=CY_RTOS_AWARE TEST_REVERT
      ```

16. Edit the app version in the *\<OTA Application>/Makefile* by setting `APP_VERSION_MINOR` to **2**.

17. Build the application per Step 8.

18. After a successful build, copy the *mtb-example-ota-https.bin* file from *\<OTA Application>/build/\<KIT>/Debug* and paste it into the *\<OTA Application>/scripts* directory.

19. Edit the *\<OTA Application>/scripts/ota_update.json* file to modify the value of `Version` to **1.2.0**.

20. The OTA application will now find this new v1.2.0 image and update it. After the update, within a few seconds, the watchdog timer resets the devices. Upon reset, MCUboot reverts to the v1.1.0 good image.

    **Figure 6. Reverting to good image**

    ![](images/reverting_to_good_image.png)


**Note:** After completing the last step, the device will be running the v1.1.0 good image and the server will still have the v1.2.0 bad image. Because the version of the image on the server is greater than the version of the image on the device, the device will re-download the v1.2.0 bad image. This causes an infinite upgrade and reverts the cycle. To avoid this scenario, stop the HTTP/HTTPS server after you test the code example. In a production environment, the application is responsible for blacklisting bad image versions and avoiding upgrading to them in the future.


## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<OtaHttps> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

**Note:** **(Only while debugging)** On the CM4 CPU, some code in `main()` may execute before the debugger halts at the beginning of `main()`. This means that some code executes twice – once before the debugger stops execution, and again after the debugger resets the program counter to the beginning of `main()`. See [KBA231071](https://community.infineon.com/docs/DOC-21143) to learn about this and for the workaround.


## Design and implementation

This example implements two RTOS tasks: OTA client and LED blink. Both these tasks are independent and do not communicate with each other. The OTA client task initializes the dependent middleware and starts the OTA agent. The LED task blinks the user LED at a specified delay.

All the source files related to the two tasks are placed under the *\<OTA Application>/source/* directory:

 File | Description
:-----|:------
*ota_task.c*| Contains the task and functions related to the OTA client
*ota_task.h* | Contains the public interfaces for the OTA client task
*led_task.c* | Contains the task and functions related to LED blinking
*led_task.h* | Contains the public interfaces for the LED blink task
*main.c* | Initializes the BSP and the retarget-io library, and creates the OTA client and LED blink tasks
*ota_app_config.h* | Contains the OTA and Wi-Fi configuration macros such as SSID, password, HTTP/HTTPS server details, certificates, and key
*heap_usage* | Contains the code for printing heap usage

<br>

All the scripts and configurations needed for this example are placed under the *\<OTA Application>/scripts/* directory:

 File | Description
:-----|:------
*generate_ssl_cert.sh*| Shell script to generate the required self-signed CA, server, and client certificates
*ota_update.json* | OTA job document
*format_cert_key.py* | Python script to convert certificate/key to string format

<br>

The *\<OTA Application>/configs/* folder contains other configurations related to the OTA middleware and FreeRTOS.

The flow of the OTA update feature using HTTP can be represented as shown in Figure 4. The application which needs the OTA updates should run the OTA Agent. The OTA Agent spawns threads to receive OTA updates when available, without intervening with the application's core functionality. The initial application resides in the primary slot of the flash memory.

When the OTA Agent receives an update, the new image is placed in the secondary slot of the flash memory. On the next reboot, MCUboot will copy the image from the secondary slot into the primary slot and then CM4 will boot the upgraded image from the primary slot.

For more details on the features and configurations offered by the [ota-update](https://github.com/Infineon/ota-update) library, see its [README](https://github.com/Infineon/ota-update/blob/master/README.md).

Both MCUboot and the application must have an identical understanding of the memory layout. Otherwise, the bootloader may consider an authentic image as invalid. For more details on the features and configurations of the MCUboot-based bootloader, see the [README](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-psoc6-mcuboot-basic/blob/master/README.md) of the [mtb-example-psoc6-mcuboot-basic](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-psoc6-mcuboot-basic) code example.
